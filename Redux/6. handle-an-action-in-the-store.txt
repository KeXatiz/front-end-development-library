// note: Reducers in Redux are responsible for the state modifications that take place in response to actions. A reducer takes state and action as arguments, and it always returns a new state. Another key principle in Redux is that state is read-only. In other words, the reducer function must always return a new copy of state and never modify state directly.

//An object of Redux action types that the resource reducer responds to. Dispatch these from action creators to change the state of your store.  https://redux-resource.js.org/api-reference/action-types
